             =========
             Changelog

1.0

* First build.


1.1

* Fixed bug preventing the open file dialog to pop up on Windows machines.
* Linked against QT libraries statically to eliminate dependency problems.
* Simplified compilation thanks to modified project files.


1.2

* Implemented preemphasis formula for higher accuracy of boundary/wall reflexion factors
* Extended reflexion factor range to [-1.0, +1.0] (formerly [0.0, +1.0])


2.0

* Implemented frequency dependent boundaries.
* Implemented velocity sources.
* fixed the delta-pulse source to work correctly.
* Added the possibility to specify digital filters for the walls in the sim file.
* Added the possibility to specify an angle matrix in the sim file to achieve
  higher accuracy of skewed walls and velocity sources.
* Added a new parameter "rho" (air density in kg/m^3) in the sim file, which is
  needed for the velocity sources.
* New sim file format is introduced with this version; it is no longer compatible
  to older sim files. This was necessary due to the changes above.
* Added a "walls"-checkbox to the GUI, which makes walls and receivers visible in
  the visualization window.
* Added the command line parameter "-walls" which does the same like clicking
  manually on the walls checkbox (see above).
* Added the command line parameter "-exit" which forces lambda to terminate itself
  on the end of a simulation. This is very useful for batch processing of multiple
  simulations.
* Added a progress indicator in lambda's status line.
