 - Added support for encoding audio tracks!  See the new
   Revel_EncodeAudio() function for details.
 - Added Revel_InitializeParams() function, used to initialize
   a Revel_Params object to safe default values.  Every Revel application
   should call this function!
 - Added Revel_GetVersion() and Revel_GetApiVersion() functions,
   for testing binary compatibility between different versions of Revel.

10/26/2004 -- Version 1.0.1 is released
 - Fixed compatibility problems with Cygwin and DJGPP.
 - Adding missing header files to avilib.c; their absence would cause
   Revel_EncodeEnd() to fail on certain platforms.  (Found & fixed by
   Julien Monville).

09/12/2004 -- Version 1.0pre1 is released
 - Initial public release
 - It works!  Use it!
