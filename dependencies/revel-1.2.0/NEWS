 ! Important - Take note!
--------------------------------------------

x/xx/2009 -- Version 1.2.0 is released
 ! Public API changes! This version is not backwards-compatible with previous
   releases!  Details below.
 + Added project files for Visual Studio 2005 and 2008.
 + Added Revel_IsEncoderValid() function, to test the validity of an encoder
   handle.
 + Added origin member to Revel_Params structure, which is used to specify
   whether frame.pixels[0] is the upper-left or lower-left corner of the
   frame.  This helps to deal with systems like OpenGL that would otherwise
   produce vertically-flipped movies.
 - Revel_CreateEncoder() can now safely be called from the constructors of
   global static objects.  Previously, it was vulnerable to a crash due to
   the unpredictable initialization order of global static objects.
 - Changed FourCC code from "xvid" to "XVID" for better compatibility with
   other video tools. Thanks to Clement Leung for this fix!
 - Internal code no longer uses the Standard Template Library, which avoids
   some link errors in Visual C++ 2008.
 * The Revel_Params object is now passed to Revel_CreateEncoder() instead
   of Revel_EncodeStart().

12/8/2004 -- Version 1.1.0 is released
 + Added support for encoding audio tracks!  See the new
   Revel_EncodeAudio() function for details.
 + Added Revel_InitializeParams() function, used to initialize
   a Revel_Params object to safe default values.  Every Revel application
   should call this function!
 + Added Revel_GetVersion() and Revel_GetApiVersion() functions,
   for testing binary compatibility between different versions of Revel.

10/26/2004 -- Version 1.0.1 is released
 - Fixed compatibility problems with Cygwin and DJGPP.
 - Adding missing header files to avilib.c; their absence would cause
   Revel_EncodeEnd() to fail on certain platforms.  (Found & fixed by
   Julien Monville).

09/12/2004 -- Version 1.0pre1 is released
 - Initial public release
 - It works!  Use it!
