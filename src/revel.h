/** \mainpage Revel (The Really Easy Video Encoding Library)
 * The Revel library provides the shortest path between your application and
 * high-quality video output.
 *
 * Using Revel generally involves the following sequence of function calls:
 * - Ensure binary compatibility by testing REVEL_API_VERSION against
 *   Revel_GetApiVersion().
 * - Create an encoder with Revel_CreateEncoder().
 * - Declare a Revel_Params object. Initialize it to safe defaults with
 *   Revel_InitializeParams(), and then fill in the fields to fit your
 *   application's needs.
 *   Call Revel_EncodeStart() to begin the encoding process, passing in
 *   the Revel_Params object you created in the previous step.
 * - Use Revel_EncodeFrame() to pass in individual video frames in
 *   the order you'd like them to appear.  Optionally, you can
 *   use Revel_EncodeAudio() to provide an audio track for your movie.
 * - Stop the encoding process with Revel_EncodeEnd().  This finalizes
 *   the output movie and makes it viewable.  Don't skip this step!
 * - Destroy the encode object with Revel_DestroyEncoder().
 */

/** \example reveltest.cpp
 * This file contains a complete demonstration of Revel in action.
 * It generates a short movie of an animating checkerboard
 * pattern, complete with audio.
